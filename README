USB control for a 2 line HD44870 style LCD display.

(for photo of breadboarded trial, see https://github.com/rickknowles/usb-lcd-2line/blob/master/photo.jpg)

Uses:
 * V-USB for the AVR microcontroller firmware (driving the LCD)
 * Peter Fleury's LCD control libraries on AVR
 * libusb for windows/mac/linux host side control software

TODO:
 * Publish schematic properly - very similar to http://dicks.home.xs4all.nl/avr/usbtiny/ir.gif, 
   but minus the IR LED receiver, slightly different pin assignments and different firmware.
 * Circuit board layout. Need to take one of @taykenee's Eagle classes or pick the brains
   of Robin and/or Akiba
