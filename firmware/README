Firmware for the USB-LCD device

Steps:
 1. cd firmware
 2. Edit Makefile avrdude settings for your programmer (USBTiny, stk500, etc)
 3. Connect AVR programmer to chip
 4. make clean flash fuse

If you have trouble on your version of GCC for avr getting it less than 2KB 
compiled size, try just directly burning the main.hex file included in the 
checkout directly with avrdude.
